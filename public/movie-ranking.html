<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h4>Athadu</h4>
<p>This is a Telugu movie directed by Trivikram and is an action packed film.</p>

<h4>3 Idiots</h4>
<p>This is a Hindi movie directed by Rajkumar Hirani. It really makes us question the education system and if it is really achieving what is was meant to do in the first place.</p>

<h4>Taare Zaameen Par</h4>
<p>This is another Hindi movie produced by the famous actor Aamir Khan. A faithful recreation of how Indian parents pressure children into depression.</p>
