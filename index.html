        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <h3>Amadeus (Jan 2023 -> Present)</h3>
                <h5>Data Science Engineer</h5>
                    <p>My work deals with Data Science and Data Engineering projects concerning Amadeus's Flight Search Engine products.</p>
            <h3>Transvalor (Jan 2022 -> Jun 2022)</h3>
                <h5>Machine Learning Researcher</h5>
                    <p>
                        Under the guidance of Prof. Magoules and Prof. Bugiotti from CentraleSupelec, 
                        Implemented a Graph Neural Network surrogate modelto approximate the Transvalor's complex simulation engine 
                        for the forging process. This Surrogate model aids in faster parameter search spaceexploration, 
                        as the real simulation engine takes a long duration of time togenerate the output mesh.
                    </p>
            <h3>Freelancer (Jul 2021 -> Dec 2021)</h3>
